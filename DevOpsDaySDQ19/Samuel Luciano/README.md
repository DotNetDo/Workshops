# Choosing a CI tool: What about Jenkins? Does Travis work for me? TeamCity? Is it really a CI?
Nowadays, there are lots of tools for automating the process of integrating code changes produced by a team of software developers so maybe it can be a little hard to choose one. With this in mind, I will be talking about Continuous Integration tools based on three of the most popular ones like Jenkins, Travis CI, and TeamCity. Moreover, I'll show you a pipeline example on each platform and walk through the implementation of it for teaching you how to get up and running quickly with this DevOps principle.
